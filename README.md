![# A Noise Contrastive Approach to Generative Sequence Model Evaluation](https://github.com/peglegpete/gen-seq-noise/blob/master/git-title.png)

This repository contains the code and results to the experiments detailed in (LINK HERE)

tl;dr: It is misleading to use the typical objective function of generative methods, log-likelihood, as a proxy for model quality.
